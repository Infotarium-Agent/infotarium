  <h1 class="tree">The Value of Life</h1>
  <p>Every person in the world has something he cares about whether it’s an item,
    person, or goal. You have materialistic people who love items, they always want
    more and can’t live without money or items, and you have spiritual or logical people
    who learn not to get too close with their items and material, neither the people they
    care for because everything eventually dies or disappears. Sometimes something valuable
    can be an idea or goal, and these are one of the hardest things to abandon and learn to
    live without. I’m a person who learned not to get too in touch with my things because
    this was not a purpose in life, but the things i couldn’t leave are things related to
    my religion and life goals. One of these things would be my entire religion, realistically speaking anyone
    could live without their religion, but my morality, ethics, and actions would
    change drastically, and religion can’t be replaced, it is irreplaceable, but in
    a world where people say religion is degrading and bad, it can be hard to hold my
    faith when the same message appears thousands of time to me in a day. Without religion,
    there would be nothing that would help me in difficult moral situations. So
    religion is guidance for me, meaning I am close with it. Another thing is that the
    reason I learned not to have a connection with the items around me is religion
    itself, so that’s where I get my motivation.
	  Another item I can’t live without is my life goals. I taught myself not to
    get too invested emotionally in my goals because they are not easy at all, so
    I shouldn’t feel guilty or self-hatred for not accomplishing my life goals.
    Now my life goals are basically to help people, just become a philanthropist,
    but I do believe that money rules the world and that’s why I always plan to become
    a businessman. I feel if I lose it which is hardly possible because ideas and ideologies
    don’t die, but if   I do lose it, I’ll live a normal salaryman life, it’s never wrong.
    WIth being a businessman, I sometimes feel that I might begin to be corrupted
    by money if I succeed, but when I think like that, I just remember to stay in the present.
